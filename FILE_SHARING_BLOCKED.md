# File Sharing Upload Attempts - Blocked

## Attempted Services

All external file sharing services are blocked by network restrictions:

1. ‚ùå **transfer.sh** - Access denied
2. ‚ùå **file.io** - Access denied  
3. ‚ùå **0x0.st** - SSL handshake failure
4. ‚ùå **tmpfiles.org** - Access denied
5. ‚ùå **uguu.se** - Access denied

## Network Restrictions

The environment has firewall/proxy restrictions that block:
- Uploads to external file sharing services
- Certain SSL/TLS connections
- GitHub Releases API access

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Create Release First, Upload Later (Recommended)

1. **From your phone**, create the release on GitHub:
   - Visit: https://github.com/KingstonPolyAC/lif-viewer/releases/new
   - Tag: `v2.0.1`
   - Title: `Release V2.0.1 - Windows Build Fix`
   - Description: "Windows exe coming soon"
   - Publish as draft or public

2. **Later, from a computer:**
   - Download exe from server
   - Edit the release
   - Upload the exe file

### Option 2: Direct Server Access

If you have direct access to this server from a computer:

```bash
# SSH to server
ssh user@server

# Navigate to project
cd /home/user/lif-viewer

# Use GitHub CLI (if available)
gh release create v2.0.1 \
  --title "Release V2.0.1 - Windows Build Fix" \
  --notes "Windows exe with embedded frontend and WebView2" \
  build/bin/lif-viewer.exe
```

### Option 3: Alternative File Transfer

If you have server access, you could:
- Use SCP/SFTP to download to your computer
- Upload to your own cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- Then attach to GitHub release
