# Upload Options for v2.0.1 Release

Unfortunately, I cannot directly upload the exe to GitHub from this environment due to:
- No GitHub CLI access
- No GitHub authentication token configured  
- Network restrictions preventing tool installation
- API proxy only supports git operations, not GitHub releases API

## File Ready for Upload

**Location:** `/home/user/lif-viewer/build/bin/lif-viewer.exe`
**Size:** 15MB
**Checksum:**
4032e0e7f2dc931fe53dc6d1d881eaf6  /home/user/lif-viewer/build/bin/lif-viewer.exe


## Recommended Upload Methods

### Option 1: From Your Computer (When Available)

1. **Download the exe from the server:**
   ```bash
   scp user@server:/home/user/lif-viewer/build/bin/lif-viewer.exe ~/Downloads/
   ```

2. **Create release and upload:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/KingstonPolyAC/lif-viewer/releases/new
   - Tag: `v2.0.1`
   - Upload the downloaded exe

### Option 2: Using GitHub Web Interface (Simplest)

1. Visit: https://github.com/KingstonPolyAC/lif-viewer/releases/new
2. Fill in release details
3. Click "Publish release" (you can upload the exe later)
4. Edit the release to add the exe when you have computer access

### Option 3: Quick Command (When on Computer with gh CLI)

```bash
# If you have access to this server from a computer
ssh user@server
cd /home/user/lif-viewer
gh release create v2.0.1 \
  --title "Release V2.0.1 - Windows Build Fix" \
  --notes "Windows exe with embedded frontend and WebView2" \
  build/bin/lif-viewer.exe
```

## What's Been Completed

âœ… Windows exe built successfully (15MB)
âœ… Frontend assets embedded properly  
âœ… WebView2 runtime embedded
âœ… Documentation created
âœ… Tag v2.0.1 created locally
âœ… Branch pushed to GitHub
âœ… All code changes committed

## Next Step

The only remaining step is uploading the exe file to the GitHub release, which requires either:
- Access from a computer (not phone)
- Or creating the release first, then adding the exe later

The exe is ready and waiting! ðŸŽ‰
